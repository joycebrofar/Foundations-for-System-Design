## 1. Subsystem(s) Where Integrity and Security Controls Are Most Important
**Subsystems:**
- Student Booking
- Accounting and Finance
- Social Networking

**Reasons:**
- Student Booking:
    - Integrity: Ensures that the booking information (dates, resort details, payment amounts) is accurate and not tampered with. Any modification could lead to incorrect reservations, resulting in financial loss or dissatisfaction.
    - Security: Protects sensitive personal information (e.g., names, addresses, payment details) from unauthorized access or breaches.

- Accounting and Finance:
    - Integrity: Critical for maintaining accurate financial records. Any unauthorized changes could lead to financial discrepancies, fraud, or loss of trust.
    - Security: Protects sensitive financial data, including credit card information and transaction details, which are prime targets for cyberattacks.

- Social Networking:
    - Integrity: Ensures that the chat communications between students are authentic and have not been altered. This is important for trust and reliability in interactions.
    - Security: Protects user data and conversations from eavesdropping or unauthorized access, especially since it involves real-time communication.


## 2. Data That Should Be Encrypted During Transmission
**Data to Encrypt:**
- Personal Information: Names, addresses, phone numbers, and any other identifiable information.
- Payment Information: Credit card numbers, bank account details, and transaction records.
- Booking Details: Reservation dates, resort information, and any sensitive booking-related data.
- Chat Messages: Any communication occurring within the Social networking subsystem.

**Impact of Using a Cellphone:**
- Direct Interaction: If students interact with SBRU systems using a cellphone, the need for encryption remains critical. Mobile devices can be more susceptible to interception, especially over public or unsecured networks.
- Cellular Modem: If a cellphone is used as a cellular modem (tethering), the data transmitted to SBRU systems should still be encrypted. While cellular networks are generally more secure than public Wi-Fi, encryption adds an additional layer of protection against potential vulnerabilities.


In summary, encryption is essential for protecting sensitive data regardless of the device used, ensuring that personal and financial information remains secure during transmission.
