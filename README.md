# A. The Spring Breaks 'R' Us Travel Service  
The SBRU information system includes four subsystems: Resort relations, Student booking, Accounting and finance, and Social networking. 
The first three are purely Web applications, so access to those occurs through an Internet connection to a Web server at the SBRU home office. 
However, the Social networking subsystem has built-in chat capabilities. It relies on Internet access as students compare notes before they book their travel reservations, and as they chat while traveling. 
The system requires a wireless network at each resort to function properly. 
SBRU isn't responsible for installing or maintaining the resort wireless network; they only plan to provide some design specifications and guidelines for each resort. 
The resort will be responsible for connecting to the Internet and providing a secure wireless environment for the students. 

1. For which subsystem(s) is(are) integrity, and security controls most important? Why?
2. What data should be encrypted during transmission through resort wireless networks to SBRU systems? Does your answer change if students interact with SBRU systems using a cellphone (directly or as a cellular modem)?

# B. On the Spot Courier Services 
Bill Wiley wants technological capabilities for servicing his customers. 
One of the problems that Bill has is that his company is very small, so he cannot afford to develop any special-purpose equipment or even sophisticated software.

Given this limitation, Bill's need for advanced technological capabilities comes at an opportune time. 
Equipment manufacturers are developing equipment with advanced telecommunications capabilities, and freelance software developers are producing software applications – many of which provide the capabilities that Bill needs. 
The one requirement is that because this will be a live production system, it needs to be reliable, stable, error-free, dependable, and maintainable. 

Here are some of the required capabilities of the new system. 

Customers 
- Customers can request package pickup via the Internet.
- Customers can check the status of package via the Internet.
- Customers can print mailing labels at their offices.

Drivers 
- Drivers can view their schedules via a portable digital device while on their routes.
- Drivers can update the status of packages while on their routes.
- Drivers can allow customers to "sign" for packages that are delivered.
- The system "knows" where the driver is on his route and can send updates in real-time.
- Drivers can accept payments and record them on the system. Bill Wiley (management)
- Bill can record package pickups from warehouse
- Bill can schedule delivery/pickup runs.
- Bill can do accounting, billing, etc.
- Bill can access the company network from his home.

Given these requirements, do the following: 
1. What kind of fraud is possible in this scenario? By the customer? By the truck driver? By collaboration between system users? What steps should Bill take to minimize the opportunity for fraud?
2. What kind of access controls should be put in place? For the customer? (Notice the customer has no financial transactions. Would you change your answer if the customer could also make payments online?
For the truck drivers? For Bill? Are typical userID and password sufficient for all three, or would you require more or less for each?
